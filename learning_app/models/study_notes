🧠 Why we usually do module.model instead of just model

Namespace / Uniqueness

Odoo can have many modules installed.

Multiple modules could define a teacher model.

Using teacher.teacher or school.teacher avoids name conflicts.

Example:

module1 -> teacher.teacher
module2 -> teacher.teacher  # Conflict if both were just 'teacher'


Module clarity

The prefix (teacher or school) tells you which module the model belongs to.

Makes it easier when reading code or XML.

Odoo convention

Almost all Odoo models follow module_name.model_name.

Standard modules use it too, e.g., res.partner, sale.order, hr.employee

====================================================++++++=====================
🧠 Two ways to define abstract models in Odoo
1️⃣ Using models.AbstractModel (recommended)
from odoo import models, fields

class PersonBase(models.AbstractModel):
    _name = 'person.base'
    name = fields.Char()

✅ Pros:

Explicitly abstract — Odoo knows it will never create a table.

Cleaner and more readable; other developers immediately know it’s abstract.

Can define common methods, reusable in multiple classic models.

2️⃣ Using models.Model + _abstract = True
class PersonBase(models.Model):
    _name = 'person.base'
    _abstract = True
    name = fields.Char()

✅ Pros:
Still works

Sometimes used in older Odoo code or examples

❌ Cons:

Less explicit

_abstract = True must be remembered, otherwise a table will be created

=============================================================================
@api.depends can track related fields and recompute values even if the change happens on a related model.

@onchange is form-view only and does not work for automatic recomputation or related fields outside the current model.
